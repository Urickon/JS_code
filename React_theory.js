HOW TO LEARN

/*
1. Always draw schemas, recap and outline your knowledges after every lesson.
2. Focus only on you study subject. In this case it is React, dont do a lot of markup or styling.
3. Try to understand how it works, not only how to write code on React.
4. Highlite on new features and focus on them but understand old features (like Class components in React)
5. Think about problems, which React is solving
